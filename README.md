#This is the HCIN720 IA3

I design and make a container for the circuit in IA2 using 3D printing. 

##Model
I measured the size of my circuit and designed the 3D model in Tinkercad. Besides, I measured and designed the mounting points for each part of my circuit.

##Results
The function of the circuit is as same as in IA2. Users can hold this container and point the sensor to detection direction  and read the output from the top of the container.

##Reflection
The size of the container's joint parts is hard to design because the outputs of 3D printing is a little bit larger than the designed model. Even I left some space at the joint parts, it was still not matched perfectly.
